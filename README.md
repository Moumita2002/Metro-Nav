# Metro-Nav
-> The Metro Nav employs a graph-based representation where each metro station is a node, storing information like station name, corridor, and connected lines. 

-> Edges represent connections between stations, with weights indicating distances. 

-> Algorithms like Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search, and Depth-First Search are employed for pathfinding, accommodating different user preferences such as shortest distance or minimum stops. 

-> After determining the shortest path and fare, the system presents users with a route guide detailing station stops, metro lines, and total fare. With a user-friendly interface, it simplifies metro journey planning and offers efficient commuting solutions while optimizing performance using heap structures and handling potential errors for a seamless experience.
